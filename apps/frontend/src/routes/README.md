# Routing

To handle routing, we use `react-router-dom`.

## Lazy Loading

It's important to ensure that we lazy load the routes as the application grows and the pages increase in complexity. 

By lazy loading, the bundler can break down the code into better chunks and serve the frontend more quickly.
